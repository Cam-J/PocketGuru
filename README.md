# PocketGuru

## HND Computer Science Project
The Pocket Guru web development and server solution was the final project of my HND. We were given the task of creating a response website and server solution for a client.
The two options for undertaking this task was to: 

- Make a website using a CMS like wordpress and deploy it using a webserver like Apache or NGINX on a Raspberry Pi
- Create a website without the use of a CMS using languages we had been taught during our studies and deploy it using a webserver like Apache or NGINX on a Raspberry Pi

I chose to create the website form the ground up as I wanted to further my knowledge of web development. This GitHub repository displays all of the development aside from any webserver config.
